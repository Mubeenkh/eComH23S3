Codeception, Gherkin, and Composer
Composer allows us to require things into our project

//1. create the feature 
	==> codecept g:feature Acceptance google

//2. write the gherkin text in the new file
	GHERKIN:
	**Codeception is case sensitive 
	Given 	- the precondition
  	  And (OPTIONAL)
	When  	- the action
  	  And (OPTIONAL)
	Then	- the expected outcome
  	  And (OPTIONAL)


//3. how to run the test
codecept run Acceptance google.feature

//4. Assertions is saying what to expect. Need to have assertions in oder to run tests
//if you want to generate all the missing functions type 
	==> codecept gherkin:snippet Acceptance
	//copy the code and paste it in/tests/Support/Helper/AccaptanceTester.php

//5. After pasting, you need to "fix" the code
	**The Assertion is the "see" and "dont see"

***********************
TDD: Test-Driven Development
BDD: Behaviour-Driven Development
	1) Define the wanted Behaviour
	2) Code until it satisfies the wanted test

Define an acceptance test with the client so 	


******************
//Every time i git clone, i have to write "composer install" to install the vendor file again
// because ".gitignore" doesnt push the vendor file into the github, cuz too big
1. composer install
2. codecept bootstrap

**************************
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv

.ENV
its a file that needs to be hidden from the users. You dont want them to have access to the database

Internationalisation (I18n) and Localisation (L10n)

Localisation : The part where you addapt to the local "area" , so language, currency, time,etc
	LOCALES: its a folder
	GETTEXT: allows you to load all the locales in the project folder (in the localisation)
		- views -> calls the gettext. 
			It will get gettext to output all the language strings
		 Whatever you are giving in gettext() has to be literals, so should be in '' not " "
		 _('') -> if you're in php context
		 <?= _('') ?> if you're outside of php context
		 Ex: 
		 echo "my name is $name and im dying" ///this one wont work cuz u dont kow what $name is
		 echo _('my name is ' . $name . _(' and im dying')

Internationalisation :
