If you dont want users to have access to folders or files in your application
you can deny access in the htaccess file.
	
.htaccess affects everything bellow the folder it's in (in sub folders)

Ex:	htdocs
	|App
	|   |.htaccess
	|

Deny access to the htdocs/.env file:
	In htdocs/.htaccess
		<Files .env>
		Deny from all
		</Files>

Deny access to the app folder:
	In htdocs/app/.htaccess
		Write: Deny from all
