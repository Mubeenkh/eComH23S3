DRY principle: Write code once and use it multiple times

Metadata: Attributes

<html>
	<head> <title></title> </head>
	<body> </body>

</html>

	Classes have:
		-properties
		-methods
		-metadata: information about the class, their properties, methods, contants, parameters. Ex: html file is a metadata

	metadata can be:
		-comments
		-DocComments:

	metadata does not affect how the code runs

Reflection objects:
	-things that are able to look/read the entire definition of a class and its data


...back to Access filtering:
usinf Attribures, we will define metadata criteria on Controller classes and their method.
