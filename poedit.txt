after installing poedit.net:

-j => to appends stuff

find app -regex ".*\.php" -exec xgettext -j {} ;  => to find files maybe

type nul > messages.po  => 

type messages.po => to see content of the file

ren messages.po messages.pot => change name

Make the following path: htdocs/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES
"locale" file is a file for localization

start poedit: run D:\Poedit\Poedit.exe

create and pick a language, then do the translation and save in into LC_MESSAGES

**if you make changes in the application (change word you want to translate)
Create the following bat file: copy con extract.bat
It contains: 
	type nul " messages.po
	find app -regex ".*\.php" -exec xgettext -j {} ;
	ren messages.po messages.pot
This will update the translation

setcookie("lang",$lang, 0, '/');
	"lang" =>
	$lang => the name of the language
	0 => time to live (here its infinite)
	'/' => the domain of the application( / = root to app), everything in the webpage

$rootlang = preg_split('/_/', $lang);
	getting the root language, but just whats in front Ex: FR_CA (only getting FR)
	preg_split will plit it into two
	is_array turns it into an array

bindtextdomain($lang, "locale") => where the file (FR_CA) can be found

textdomain => selecting the text file
